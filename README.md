# objective-lister
We propose an Objective-Lister app which works like a todo app to enter goals and objectives that an individual wants to achieve. Those objectives remain saved on login and one can add or delete them. We have also implemented registration and login functionalities with clean User Interface. A prompt, namely ‘Invalid Credentials’ shows up on login with incorrect credentials and access is restricted. We have also identified an OWASP vulnerability in our web app and listed its solution out.
